Balance Inquiry: View the current account balance.
Cash Withdrawal: Withdraw a specified amount, with checks to prevent overdrafts.
Deposit Funds: Add funds to the account balance.

Implementation Details:

This console-based application can be implemented in Java, focusing on object-oriented principles. Classes such as BankAccount and ATM can encapsulate related functionalities. Data persistence can be achieved using file handling or a simple database setup. Proper exception handling and input validation are crucial for a robust application.
